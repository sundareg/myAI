Classical machine learning
	- Supervised Learning
		- classification -  (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine)
			– Spam filtering
			– Language detection
			– A search of similar documents
			– Sentiment analysis
			– Recognition of handwritten characters and numbers
			– Fraud detection
		- regressions (Linear regression, Polynomial regression, RIdge regressions)
			- Stock price forecasts
			- Demand and sales volume analysis
			- Medical diagnosis
			- Any number-time correlations
			- Preduct traffic jams
	- Unsupervised Learning
		- Clustering (K-means_clustering, Mean-Shift, DBSCAN, Fuzzy C- means, Agglomerative)
			- For market segmentation (types of customers, loyalty)
			- To merge close points on a map
			- For image compression
			- To analyze and label new data
			- To detect abnormal behavior
		- Dimension reduction (PCA, LSA, SVD, LDA, t-SNE)
			- Recommender systems
			- Beautiful visualizations
			- Topic modeling and similar document search
			- Fake image analysis
			- Risk management
		- Association or Pattern search ( Apriori,Euclat, FP-growth)
			- To forecast sales and discounts
			- To analyze goods bought together
			- To place the products on the shelves
			- To analyze web surfing patterns
Reinforcement Learning ( Q-Learning, SARSA, DQN, A3C, Genetic algorithm)
	- Self-driving cars
