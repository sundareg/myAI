Dear all,

 

Today’s Use case:

- Please scrape a property (real estate) website with the following variables.


Example record:
Property type: Apartment (Only apartment type you can consider)
Property size: e.g 3,169 sqft / 294 sqm
Bedrooms: 3
Bathrooms: 5
furnished: Yes or no
Rent: Price (This is Y)
Balcony: Yes/no

Objective: Find a rent of the apartment for a given input X (size, etc)

Use case: User want to know the trend (predict) of the rent (Response Y) at particular location with specific needs (Input X).

Today’s work:
- Choose right algorithm
- Implement using Python/Scikit Learn
- Use Requests, and other scraping libraries we discussed.
- Keep 20 or 30 % records for Testing
- Please find the error (which must be low to have quality model)
- Create a one page report on your findings

 

Note: We have already solved similar problem.

 

As I have 3 or 4 meetings today, Please continue the use case implementation. Classes will continue tomorrow.

 

Thank you
